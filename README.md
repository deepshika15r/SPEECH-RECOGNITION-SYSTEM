#description

This project focuses on the development of a **speech recognition-based system** that enables voice-controlled operation of a digital notice board using an Android smartphone. The objective is to create a hands-free, efficient, and wireless method for updating and displaying messages on an electronic notice board by utilizing the capabilities of speech recognition and Bluetooth communication technology.

The core of the system is built around **speech recognition technology** integrated into the Android mobile platform. By using the “Voice Arduino Control” app, the system allows users to convert spoken language into digital commands. When a user speaks into their Android device, the built-in speech-to-text engine processes the voice input, recognizes the spoken words, and translates them into textual messages. This text data is then transmitted wirelessly via **Bluetooth** to an **Arduino-based microcontroller**, which acts as the receiver and controller for the notice board.

On the hardware side, the Arduino microcontroller is connected to a **20x4 LED matrix display**, which serves as the output medium for displaying the received messages. The microcontroller receives the message through a Bluetooth module (such as HC-05 or HC-06), interprets the data, and outputs the message onto the LED display. The system is designed to support short to medium-length messages and can refresh the display content in real-time based on new voice commands received.

This speech recognition-based approach offers several key benefits. It enables **real-time updates** without physical interaction with the hardware, **reduces manual effort**, and **increases the accessibility** of the system, particularly for users who may have physical limitations or need to update content quickly in emergency situations. Furthermore, using Android's native voice recognition eliminates the need for additional hardware for speech processing, making the system both cost-effective and user-friendly.

In terms of communication, Bluetooth ensures a reliable and secure wireless link between the smartphone and the Arduino device within a typical range of 10 meters. This makes the system highly suitable for indoor environments such as **schools, hospitals, offices, transportation hubs, and shopping centers**, where announcements and information need to be updated frequently and viewed by a wide audience.

Overall, this project demonstrates a practical application of **speech recognition in embedded systems** and showcases how voice-controlled interfaces can enhance user interaction with electronic devices. By integrating mobile voice processing with microcontroller-based display systems, it offers an innovative and modern solution to traditional notice board systems. The project also paves the way for future enhancements, such as multi-language support, Wi-Fi-based communication, or integration with cloud-based voice services for remote access and control.
